    <p class="text-justify body-1">
      Your turn to clean the bathroom! No, I already cleaned last week and the
      week before that. To avoid arguing, you can distribute and document all
      your tasks here.
    </p>
    <div class="title mb-1">First Task</div>
    <p class="text-justify body-1">
      With the round plus in the upper right corner you can create new tasks.
      You can divide your tasks into three categories:
    </p>
    <div class="title mb-1">Repeating Tasks</div>
    <p class="text-justify body-1">
      For classic tasks, such as cleaning the bathroom, which must be made
      regularly, there is the "Repeating" mode. Here you can set a titel and the
      "Member mode".With this setting you can assign always the task to the same
      person or you can switch through. Under "Time and Date" you can then
      select the starting event and set repetitions. First select on which days
      of the week and then after how many weeks or months it should be repeated.
      You can also activate a "Toggle Reminder", so that the person in charge
      does not forget the task.
    </p>
    <div class="title mb-1">Single Tasks</div>
    <p class="text-justify body-1">
      For a one-time task, you can choose the mode "Single". Since the task is
      only available once, the setting "Member mode" is deactivated here. So
      select someone and set the date of the task.
    </p>
    <div class="title mb-1">On-Demand Tasks</div>
    <p class="text-justify body-1">
      There are tasks that do not have to be done every week, but are more
      irregular. For example, taking out the garbage depends on how much was
      cooked or bought throug out a day. Therefore we got "on-demand tasks".
      Similar to the "Repeating Tasks" you can choose the "Member mode" again,
      but though the regularity is not given the time selection is deactivated.
    </p>
    <div class="title mb-1">Upcoming Tasks</div>
    <p class="text-justify body-1">
      Here you will find all upcoming tasks, divided into "Timed Tasks" and
      "On-Demand Tasks". Each of the three task categories has a different
      colour in the display. Next to each task there are different options.
      Besides changing and checking off, there is also the possibility to send a
      reminder to the person who is assigned.
    </p>
    <div class="title mb-1">Recently finished tasks</div>
    <p class="text-justify body-1">
      All tasks completed so far are noted and documented here so that everyone
      can see when what was done.
