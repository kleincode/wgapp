      Finances

    <p class="text-justify body-1">
      While living in a shared apartment, there are always expenses that benefit
      everyone. In order not to lose the overview, you can enter all these
      expenses under "Finances".
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify body-1">
      If you have bought something like this, click on "New Expence" and enter
      your expenditure. To show full transparency you can also upload the
      receipt here. If you don't feel like taking a picture of the receipt at
      the moment or to clear faults, you can add the bill later or edit your
      Entry under "Actions".

      At the top right you can choose a time span over which the expances should
      be displayed. This setting affects beside the "Member Expances" also the
      overview and the trendcurve below.
