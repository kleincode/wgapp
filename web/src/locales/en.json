We design this app like we would work on a website - with all the advantages of web development: We can develop for all devices simultaneously. A PWA will run on every system and now we come to the cool part: You don't need an installation but if you want to use it like a real app you just need one click. For all the geeks out there: We used Node.js with Vue.js and Vuetify as our framework. The data is stored securely in a MySQL database."
